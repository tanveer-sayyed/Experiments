## Why AI in FI? 
In Stock market, its machines talking to machines and competing with machines. And machines are not humans! They "think" diffirently; its certain that only a machine can defeat a machine, and not a human. Hence it is important that the algorithms that we create have zero human intervention, ideally. Following is an attempt to build the same, for intra-day frequency. The attempt here is to be able to take an opposite position, i.e. if a market is falling, strike on a call; if the market is rising strike on a put.

## The Experiemnt
The following experiment is an attempt to predict if the direction of the next day for NIFTY Bank index. Backtesting begins from 1st Aug, 2021.



As can be seen in the above image out of the total business days in the month of August-2021 (which includes a holiday), the model was able to predict correctly the direction for 13 days.
The accuracy is thus: 61.90476%

The current accuracy of the model(as of 3rd Sep, 2021) is :

## Future
Predict also the best price at which one can hold positions for intra-day trade. The work is still in progress.
