The attempt is to learn complex concepts in the easiest way possible. Simplicity is the key.

Modern deep learning draws inspiration from many Ô¨Åelds, especially applied math fundamentals like:
- linear algebra,
- probability,
- information theory,
- numerical optimization
- computational neuroscience
- parallel distributed processing (connectionism)
